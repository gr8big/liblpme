# LibLPME Documentation

This directory contains extra detail about the LPME API. There are four
subdirectories:
1. [`server`](./server) -- Docs about the server module that the user
apps interact with.
2. [`client`](./client) -- Docs about the client module that the Roblox
server interacts with.
3. [`extras`](./extras) -- Docs about optional extras packaged with
LibLPME, and how to use them.
4. [`internal`](./internal) -- API reference for the internal protocol.
